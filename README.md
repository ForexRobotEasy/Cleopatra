2. OnTick function: The robot continuously checks for rebounds from significant price levels. If a rebound is detected, the robot calculates the lot size based on drawdown and risk management. It then opens a position with the calculated lot size.
3. CheckRebound function: This function analyzes the market for rebounds from significant price levels. It should be customized with the specific logic to identify rebounds. If a rebound is detected, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
4. CalculateLotSize function: This function calculates the lot size based on drawdown and risk management. It should be customized with the specific calculation logic. The function returns the calculated lot size.
5. OpenPosition function: This function opens a position with the calculated lot size. It should be customized with the specific order execution logic. If the position is opened successfully, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
6. ClosePosition function: This function closes the position when the take profit or stop loss is reached. It should be customized with the specific order closing logic.
